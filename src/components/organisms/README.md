# Empire Dropbox — Organisms Grid

- Root: `Desktop/2025 EMPIRE/empire-dropbox/organisms`
- Purpose: staging area for all new squares (atoms, molecules, organisms) before they are pulled into the main grid.
- Server: assumes the FastAPI brain in `Master_Crypto_Bot/api_server.py` and its helpers (`indicators.py`, `strategies/`, `decision_engine.py`, `db_utils.py`) are the code and data supply.

Legend roles:
- **Codex**: atoms/molecules (sliders, switches, inputs) that expose parameters from indicators/strategies.
- **Gemini**: organisms (full boxes) composed from atoms/molecules, following the existing Command Center visual language.
- **Antigravity**: wiring boxes to live data via the FastAPI endpoints.
- **Jules**: themes (emerald, ruby, void, etc.) and polish passes.

Components dropped here can be imported into the grid from the 2025 EMPIRE app as needed.
