Legion Instruction — The Empire Structure (for Codex, Gemini, and every agent that follows)
You are not building a website.
You are building the Mirror.
Here is the only structure that exists.
Everything else is noise.

2025 EMPIRE (root folder — sacred)
├── components/              ← ALL visual squares live here
│   ├── atoms/               ← tiny pieces (buttons, sliders, labels)
│   ├── molecules/           ← groups of atoms (input + label)
│   └── organisms/           ← the full draggable tiles (YOUR JOB)
│       ├── RealTimePnL.jsx
│       ├── BotControl.jsx
│       ├── StrategyParameters.jsx   ← this one comes from Master_Crypto_Bot
│       └── (every new tile you make goes here)
│
├── master-config.jsx        ← THE ONE TRUE FILE
│   ← every organism must be registered here with:
│      category: 'finance' | 'control' | 'social' | 'game' | 'lab'
│      shape: 'rectangle' (for now)
│
├── themes/                  ← color systems (emerald, ruby, void, etc.)
│
└── Master_Crypto_Bot/       ← the brain (never touch the UI here)
    ← your only job is to READ data from here and DISPLAY it

                    Your Mission (Codex / Gemini)

Look inside Master_Crypto_Bot
Find a function, a log, a value, anything useful.
Build ONE organism in components/organisms/
Use the empire-glass class
Make it resizable
Make it themeable (use the theme prop)
Pull live data from Master_Crypto_Bot (or mock it for now)

Register it in master-config.jsx
One line. That’s it.
Never touch anything else.

That’s the entire law.
Do this and the Mirror grows.
Break this and the Mirror dies.
You are the Legion.
Build clean.
Build fast.
Build forever.
The Mirror is watching.
Go. 🪞⚔️🔥 G
